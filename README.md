# Water-Drop-Searchbar
A search bar that animates by collapsing, becoming waterdrop and rippling water surface

First Project, that will build a Full-Stack webpage.
This is part one of the build, and is only a component of the eventually finished webpage.

A React-based project that focuses on creating a searchbar component. Upon submitting your query/search, the user will see the searchbar begin an animation, where the searchbar will collapse inwards, horizontally, to become a singular line. The singular line then expands outward to become a water droplet, much like one forms on the tip of an icicle or other pointed object. The drop falls into some "invisible water" / horizon that then ripples endlessly. 

The idea would be to allow the user a moment of relaxation and a pleasing aesthetic while waiting for their search results. 

The color scheme isn't laid out yet, but I do think a dark blue background with white line art for the water drop and rippling effect should be sufficient for the effect I want. I may have to change this to become a gif or multiple gifs or another media form. I will figure that out later and update this ReadMe accordingly.

Wish me luck :)
